A short history of the company

World Wide Spamwas started in the summer of 2000. The business
concept was to ride the dot-com wave and to make money both trough
bulk email and by selling canned meat online.

After receiving several complaints from costumers who weren't
satisfied by their bulk email, World Wide Spam altered their profile, 
and focused 100% on canned goods. Today, they rank as the world's
13,892nd online supplier of SPAM.
